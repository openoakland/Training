Training
========

Areas we want to develop or conduct training for our crew and for the public

- [View existing trainings/ideas (click here)](https://github.com/openoakland/Training/issues)

- [Add your own training idea! (click here)](https://github.com/openoakland/Training/issues/new)
 - indicate an area you'd like us to focus on
 - mention if it's a **simple** tool/process or a **more advanced** set of trainings.

We can build up our resources over on our P2PU when they're developed. Comment on a training and say if you can take on a specific training request.
